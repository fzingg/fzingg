**Frederic ZINGG — French/Swiss**
**Master's in Mathematics & Computer Science**

Software Engineer and Technical Lead with 20+ years of experience designing, building, and delivering software products — from full-stack web applications to cloud-native data platforms and AI-powered systems.

Currently focused on AI agent integration, workflow automation, and cloud platform architecture. My daily work involves architecting multi-tenant automation platforms, building and orchestrating complex workflows (N8N, Cloud Functions), developing Python and JavaScript services that interface with LLM agents via gRPC, and leveraging AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code to accelerate delivery. I design end-to-end solutions that connect MCP servers, AI agents, and third-party systems into cohesive, production-ready infrastructure on Google Cloud. This includes building MCP server tooling and supporting API services from customer requirements through to production — with agent behaviour testing and integration across diverse data platforms (Snowflake, BigQuery, Cloud SQL).

Grounded in strong computer science and software engineering fundamentals, I have deep experience with systems-level and application-level languages — C++, Rust, Ruby, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go — giving me the ability to reason about performance, memory, and architecture at every layer of the stack. I have designed and built dozens of RESTful APIs across these languages, and integrated them into automated workflows using platforms such as N8N, Cyclr, Zapier, and Make.

Data engineering is a core part of my skill set. I design and operate data pipelines on Google Cloud Platform — Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, BigQuery, Cloud SQL — and have hands-on experience with BI migration (Dundas BI → ThoughtSpot), ETL orchestration, data modelling, and CDP evaluation (RudderStack, Segment). I have also planned and implemented a GenAI-ready data stack — including dbt for transformation, semantic layer modelling, and integration with LLM agents for natural-language data querying. I approach data infrastructure with the same rigour I bring to application code: tested, documented, and built for scale.

I thrive in remote, cross-functional teams and care deeply about clear communication, collaboration, and supporting colleagues on customer-facing teams. I lead by staying close to the product — from initial conversation through to production readiness, including performance, security, and high-load preparation.
