# Nice to see you

Welcome to my page.
I am Fr√©d√©ric ZINGG, software engineer from France and Switzerland.

After more than 20 years of building client/server solutions mainly with RUBY / RubyonRails / Javascript and React / Websocket / Redis, I am now really crazy about coding in RUST + Multi-threading + Asynchrounous and P2P architectures and protocols including blockchains solutions and smart-contracts coding (Elrond / Starknet / Ethereum / The internet computer).
